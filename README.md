# User Interface Project: Great Idea Web Page

Being able to create a user interface from a design file is considered a basic necessity for front end developers. We will be building a single page website throughout this week to get plenty of practice using HTML and CSS.  We will approach the same layout in several different ways so that we can learn the many challenges of building user interfaces.  The first challenge will be to build the interface using only the box model and `display: inline-block`.  You can use floats and clears if you want as well! The second challenge will be to re-build your first `inline-block` build with `flexbox` techniques.  **Do not skip the first challenge!**  The learnings you will gain from `inline-block` layout are important for you to understand.

**Hint**
The HTML structure is already in the project, you can use that as a guide for your CSS. **If you want to stretch yourself, delete the HTML and start from scratch.**

### Challenge 1: `display:inline-block`
Only use `display:inline-block` and box model CSS properites to layout the [Great Idea design](design-files/desktop.jpg).

***Useful Resource: [Layout Using inline-block](http://learnlayout.com/inline-block-layout.html)***

***Objectives:*** 
- Style the provided HTML using `display:inline-block` and box model CSS properties only. 
- Try to make your styles match as close to the [desktop design](design-files/desktop.jpg) as you can.
- Aim for coding the whole page from navigation all the way to the footer
- **Stretch Goal**: Delete the provided HTML and build your own file.

### Challenge 2: `display: flexbox`
Building layouts with `flexbox` is way more fun compared to inline-block but `flexbox` comes with a lot more things to learn.  This challenge is to use the [same layout design file](design-files/desktop.jpg) as challenge 1 but now you will use flexbox to control your layout isntead of `inline-block`.

***Useful Resource: [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)***

***Objectives:***
- You must complete challenge 1 before attempting challenge 2.
- Incorporate `flexbox` where you were using `inline-block`.
- Aim for coding the whole page from navigation all the way to the footer
- **Stretch Goal**: Delete the provided HTML and build your own file.

**If you accomplish both challenges early, push yourself to build the other pages in the navigation**
